# master-deep_learning

This repository showcases projects and implementations from my Master's degree, with a focus on Deep Learning concepts and a fundamental, from-scratch neural network implementation.

-----

## Repository Structure

* `DeepLearning/`

This directory holds all files related to the Deep Learning course completed during my Master's program. Here, you'll find assignments, project code, and relevant resources explored throughout the course.

* `MakeYourOwnNeuralNetwork/`

This directory features a neural network implementation built from scratch, meaning it doesn't rely on high-level frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch. This foundational implementation is based on the principles outlined in two key resources:

    - "Make Your Own Neural Network" by Tariq Rashid (2016)
    - "Neural Networks from Scratch in Python" by Harrison Kinsley (2020)

This section offers a deep dive into the core mechanics of neural networks, providing a clear understanding of their underlying operations.

-----

## Getting Started

To access and explore the code, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:thiagoneye/master-deep_learning.git
```

Once cloned, navigate into the respective directories (`DeepLearning/` or `MakeYourOwnNeuralNetwork/`) to find the code and any specific instructions or dependencies within their individual README files.

-----

## Technologies Used

While specific technologies and libraries may vary slightly by project, the primary tools and libraries generally include:

* **Python**
* **NumPy**: Essential for numerical operations, especially in the `MakeYourOwnNeuralNetwork/` section.
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
