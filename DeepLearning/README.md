# Deep Learning Coursework

This directory contains all the files, assignments, and projects completed as part of my Deep Learning course during my Master's program. It serves as a comprehensive record of the concepts learned and practical applications developed throughout the course.

## Contents

Within this folder, you'll find a variety of materials, likely organized into subdirectories for each assignment or project. Expect to see:

* **Jupyter Notebooks** (.ipynb): These will contain the code, explanations, and visualizations for various assignments and practical exercises.
* **Python Scripts** (.py): Standalone scripts for models, data processing, or utility functions.
* **Datasets**: Smaller datasets used for specific exercises or links/instructions on how to download larger ones.
* **Reports/Documentation**: Any written reports, analyses, or detailed explanations accompanying the code.

## Key Topics Covered

The coursework in this directory generally covers fundamental and advanced topics in Deep Learning, which may include:

* **Fundamentals of Neural Networks**: Perceptrons, activation functions, backpropagation.
* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Architectures like LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, for image classification and computer vision tasks.
* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: LSTMs and GRUs for sequential data, natural language processing (NLP), and time series analysis.
* **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Principles and basic implementations for generative tasks.
* **Transfer Learning**: Utilizing pre-trained models for new tasks.
* **Optimization Algorithms**: SGD, Adam, RMSprop, etc.
* **Regularization Techniques**: Dropout, L1/L2 regularization.
* **Frameworks**: Practical application using popular deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch).

## How to Navigate

To explore the content, simply browse the subdirectories. Each major assignment or project should have its own dedicated folder. Look for .ipynb files for executable code and explanations, and any accompanying README.md files within subfolders for specific instructions or context.

-----

## Dependencies

The specific dependencies will vary depending on the project. However, common libraries you'll likely need include:

* `tensorflow`
* `pytorch`
* `keras`
* `numpy`
* `pandas`
* `matplotlib`
* `scikit-learn`
* `jupyter` (to run the notebooks)

You can usually install these using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow torch keras numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```
